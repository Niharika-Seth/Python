# How to define tuples 
t = (1,2,3,4,'python')
print(t)
print("the data type of t is: " , type(t))

# Tuples are immutable built in data type that stores values of different data types together.
# To create a tuple with single value always add , at the end of the element. (with multiple values , is optional)
a = (1,)
print("The data type of a is: " , type(a))

# To access elements of tuple
print("The element at 1 index: " , t[1])
print("The element at 4 index: " , t[4])
